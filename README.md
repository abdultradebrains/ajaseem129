# About me

<img src="imgs/helloThere.gif" height='100%' width='100%'>

I'm Abdul, I'm an Enthusiastic developer who dabbles in a little bit of everything. I love to experiment and learn new technologies and consistently work towards improving my code.
My current knowledge base includes :

- Android App Development using Java/Kotlin and Flutter
- Backend Development using NodeJS and Python/Django(Advanced)
- Frontend Web Development using ReactJs and NextJS
- A little bit of .NET, just enough to build a CLI App to automate a task
- The Ability to fix up my servers just as fast as they went down

## What do I do now?

I currently work as a Tech Lead at Tradebrains, building tech that scales and meets deadlines that would otherwise be deemed impossible ðŸ¤£.
A question that would arise from going through my GitHub would be the lack of projects, which is a little bit of a work in progress. Expect to see some more work here soon!!!!

## Where am I headed?

There's so much yet to be explored and I am the explorer. I work towards a future where I travel the world, try out new cuisines, make new friends, learn different languages(Not just programming languages for once :joy: ) and so much more.

## My interests?

I love to

- play games
- binge anime
- Read manga
- listen to music
